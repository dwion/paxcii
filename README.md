Transform images and videos to ascii with a cli tool or rust crate.<br>

<img src="example.png" width="500"><br>

I haven't forgotten about this project and I want to update it but I don't currently have the time.
It should still work. At least this git repository should.

## Dependencies
You will need ffmpeg and linux.
Also you should have a fast terminal for videos.

## Installation
### cli
```
cargo install paxcii
```
### crate
https://crates.io/crates/paxcii

## How to use
For the cli the help message will tell you all you need.<br>

For the crate look at the [docs](https://docs.rs/paxcii/latest/paxcii/).<br>
You can also look at the cli source code. It works as an example.
